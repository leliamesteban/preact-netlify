Apparently Joseph Addison said:

 

I do not believe that sheer suffering teaches. If suffering alone taught, all the world would be wise, since everyone suffers. To suffering must be added mourning, understanding, patience, love, openness and the WILLINGNESS TO REMAIN VULNERABLE.

 

 

Oh , how difficult is that last bit!  How much more tempting and easy it is to become closed off and protect oneself when one has been hurt.  But if we close off our heart, then we are the ones that lose out in the end.

 

Life is hard for all of us. We must strive to remain open and allow ourselves to be vulnerable or our lives, though safer , will become smaller and less rich. I believe, anyway! :)
